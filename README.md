## Conclusion
Identifying the most frequently used device to access Netflix.
Laptops are the most widely used devices to access Netflix, followed by tablets, smartphones, and smart TVs. To retain existing users and attract new ones, improving the UI and user experience across all devices is recommended.

Determining the subscription type that generates the most revenue.
Despite being the cheapest, the basic subscription type generates the highest revenue. Enhancing its UI and user experience could help attract and retain more subscribers.

Pinpointing the countries that yield the most revenue.
The U.S. and Spain generate the highest monthly revenues. Marketing campaigns could target these countries, offering exclusive content or early access to subtitles in their respective languages.

Assessing the distribution of gender by country.
In the U.S., there are more male Netflix users, while Spain has more female users. Tailoring the recommendation algorithm based on gender for each country can enhance user experience.

Calculating the duration users have been with Netflix.
A majority of users have subscribed to Netflix for over a year. Offering exclusive early access to new episodes or referral benefits could incentivize long-term commitment.

Descriptive statistics on the age of users.
The average age of Netflix users is around 38.79 with a median of 39. Given that individuals around this age are typically employed, offering promotional discounts during payday could attract new subscribers.

Investigating the relationship between the number of Netflix subscribers and monthly revenue.
A correlation value of 0.03 indicates a weak positive correlation between subscription type and monthly revenue. The relationship is not statistically significant.

Final Conclusion:
To increase Netflix's new user count by 15% over six months, marketing strategies could focus on enhancing device-specific user experience, particularly for basic subscribers, refining film recommendation algorithms by gender, providing exclusive early access benefits, offering promotional discounts during payday periods, and prioritizing language-specific content for countries with high user counts.
